Bachelor's Thesis Research

1. zenith_recon contains files that use the oscillation probability generator to calculate probabilities using reconstructed neutrino events, and generate useful plots and calculations.
2. wcsim contains files that plots and compares histograms with various selection criteria put upon simulated events for analysis.
3. fitqun contains files that plot histograms to analyse reconstructed events.
4. sensitivity contains files that produce the final calculations and plots required for the oscillation analysis.
